# LIV-testProject
<br>
Storing a file on the third-party system may not be safe. To securely store files on server, one can use various encryption techniques and to store the keys, key managers can be used. Our tool LIV will use multiple encryption algorithms along with the managed keys.

​The project is being carried out in two phases, each having separate modules. In phase one, the user can perform cryptographic activities on the selected file based on the chosen level of security. In phase two, the user can share their encrypted file with other users using the same tool. ​
